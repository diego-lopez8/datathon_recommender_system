**Recommendation System: The Machine Learning Challenge**
Goal: To enhance the shopping experience of customers, product recommenders are often used

-   They take transactional, user, and product data to provide personalised recommendations
-   These allow customers to be targeted with the products that they are most likely to purchase, increasing sales for the retailer

During this challenge, you will construct a product recommender

-   You will generate products that you think should be recommended to a list of customers based on the data available
-   You will then report your findings back, imagining that you are a data scientist presenting to a retailer that has hired you to do this work
-   This challenge will require great technical and communication skills, with each group constructing a recommender and also explaining what you have done to a non-technical audience
